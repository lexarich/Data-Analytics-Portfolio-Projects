# DATA CLEANING IN SQL

## **Project Overview**:
In this project, we take raw layoffs data and transform it using SQL Server to make it more usable for analysis. The raw data often comes with inconsistencies, missing values, and various anomalies that can hinder meaningful analysis. By leveraging the power of SQL, we perform comprehensive data cleaning and transformation to ensure the data is accurate, complete, and ready for insightful analysis.

## **Key Steps**:
1. **Data Import**: Load the raw layoffs data into SQL Server.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicates
   - Handle missing values
   - Standardize data formats
3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Normalize and structure data for better usability
   - Create derived columns for enhanced analysis
4. **Quality Assurance**: Validate the cleaned data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
5. **Documentation**: Detailed comments and explanations for each SQL script.

## **Tools Used**:
- SQL Server

## **Outcome**:
A cleaned and transformed dataset ready for deeper analysis and visualization, enabling more accurate and meaningful insights from the layoffs data.
